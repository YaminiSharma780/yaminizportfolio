            I have developed numerous responsive and animated frontend web apps
            using React, leveraging the power of Tailwind, HTML, and CSS. My
            focus is on crafting intuitive web applications that deliver a
            seamless user experience. I consistently follow best practices to
            ensure performance and accessibility projects.

            I have built fullstack web applications with a killer frontend using
            React, Redux, and Tailwind, paired with a robust backend powered by
            Node.js and Express. Iâ€™ve worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases,
            and developed RESTful APIs to handle seamless communication between
            the frontend and backend.

            I can bring your web app idea to life by designing intuitive user
            interfaces in Figma and delivering fullstack development using the
            power of React and Node.js. From concept to deployment, I ensure a
            seamless build process and I also provide post-development support
            to keep your app running smoothly.
